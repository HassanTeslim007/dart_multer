# Dart Multer - A Dart Utility for File Uploads

`Dart Multer` is a backend-agnostic Dart utility inspired by the popular `Multer` npm package. It simplifies the handling of file uploads by converting `UploadedFile` objects into usable `dart:io File` objects. The utility temporarily saves these files to disk and supports middleware integration for frameworks like Dart Frog and Shelf.

## Features

- Converts `UploadedFile?` into a temporary `dart:io File`.
- Saves files to disk with customizable file names and directories.
- Integrates as middleware for Dart Frog and Shelf frameworks.
- Optional file cleanup after processing.
- Provides an easy API to handle file uploads in Dart-based backends.

## Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_multer: ^0.1.0
```

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage
### Save File to Disk
Use DartMulter.saveToFile() to save an UploadedFile to disk.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:dart_multer/dart_multer.dart';

Future<void> saveUploadedFile(UploadedFile uploadedFile) async {
  try {
    File file = await DartMulter.saveToFile(uploadedFile);
    print('File saved to: ${file.path}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error saving file: $e');
  }
}
```

### Middleware for Dart Frog
DartMulter.fileUploadMiddleware() can be used in Dart Frog to handle file uploads automatically.

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
import 'package:dart_multer/dart_multer.dart';

Handler middleware(Handler handler) {
  return handler
      .use(DartMulter.fileUploadMiddleware(fields: ['avatar', 'resume']))
      .handler;
}
```

### Customization Options
- keepFile: Set to true if you want the uploaded files to persist beyond the request.

- filename: Provide a custom filename for the uploaded file.

- directory: Specify a custom directory to save the file, otherwise it will be saved in the systemâ€™s temporary directory.
